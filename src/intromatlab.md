# An introduction to MATLAB

MATLAB / Simulink is a software tool for:
- Performing mathematical calculations and signal processing,
- Data analysis and visualization: you have several graphical tools,
- Modeling of physical systems and phenomena,
- Testing and simulation of engineering projects.

```

1. The **command window** is where you type MATLAB commands following the prompt:
  ```
  >>
  ```
2. The **workspace** window shows all the variables you have defined in the
current session. Variables can actually be manipulated within the workspace
window.

3. The **command history** shows all MATLAB commands you have used recently,
including past sessions as well.

4. The **current folder** shows all files in whichever folder has been selected
to be the current folder.

## Arithmetic operations and order of operations

- The basic operations are addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), the
multiplication (`*`), division (`\`), exponentiation (`^`),
- The order of the operations is the *canonical* one used in mathematics and follows
the usual conventions of a scientific calculator
  1. Complete all operations in parentheses `()` using the following
   rules of precedence,
  2. Exponentiation (left to right)
  3. Multiplication and division (left to right)
  4. Addition and subtraction (from left to right)

  :::{admonition} Example
  For example, consider the following operations:

    ```matlab
    30/5*3
    5*2^4+4*(3)
    -1^8
    8^(1/3)
    ```

## Variables

As in any programming language, MATLAB makes use of **variables**, which, in
computer science, are data containers located in a portion of the memory and
intended to contain values, which can (in general) be modified during the
running a program.

A variable is characterized by a name (usually intended as a sequence of
characters and digits) which must follow a set of *conventions* that depends
on the language being used. In MATLAB the following conventions must be used:
1. Variable names must start with a letter,
2. Names can include any combination of letters, numbers, and *underscores*,
3. The maximum length for a variable name is 63 characters,
4. MATLAB is **case sensitive**. The variable named `bAll` is different from the
variable named `ball`,
5. It is a good idea to avoid the following names: `i`,` j`, `pi`, and more
generally all predefined MATLAB function names such as `length`, `char`,` size`,
`plot`,` break`, `cos`,` log`, etc.
6. It is good practice to call variables with intelligible names, that is, with
names that reflect their use within the program rather than using gods
generic variable names such as `x`,` y`, `z`.

:::{tip}
If we want to calculate the surface air of a sphere $A = 4 \pi r^2$ of radius
$r=5$, it is better to write
```matlab
radius = 5;
surface_area = 4 * pi * radius ^ 2
```
in the place of
```matlab
r = 5;
A = 4 * pi * r ^ 2
```
When we reopen the second code in a month, the chances of remembering
what we meant will be pretty scarce (or, in my case, even if I open it
in two hours).
:::

From the example we have just entered in the **workspace** we observe several
things
```matlab
radius = 5;
surface_area = 4*pi*radius^2
```
1. a `radius` variable of type `double` has been created,
2. a memory location for the variable `radius` has been allocated and
initialized to the value $5$,
3. the `;` at the end of the instruction suppresses the screen printing of the content
of the variable,
4. the variable `surface_area` is instead created and allocated using
instead one of MATLAB's predetermined quantities, the value of $\pi$, and the
content of the variable `radius` we defined earlier. Since we didn't finish the
second statement with a `;`, we see its value printed in the **command window**
```
surface_area =

  314.1593
```
At this point we can change the value of the `radius` variable simply by
reassigning it to a new amount *without* altering the value stored in the
**workspace** of the `surface_area` variable.

To display the contents of a variable, you can use the `disp` command, for
example:
```matlab
disp ("The surface area of the sphere is:"); disp (area_surface);
```
which will produce in the **command window**:
```
The surface area of the sphere is:
   314.1593
```

### Character variables and strings

We are not obliged to use only numeric variables. For **example** we can write
in the **command window**:
```matlab
student='C.F. Gauss'
```
that will print us
```
student =

    'C.F. Gauss'
```
We have built an **array** of `char`, that is a variable named` student` to
which we have assigned a memory space and in which we have inserted the
characters `C.F. Gauss`. If in doubt, we can query MATLAB about the type of
the variable with the command
```matlab
whos student
```
that will give us back
```
  Name          Size            Bytes  Class    Attributes

  student       1x10               20  char      
```
A variation on the **array** of `char` is to define a` string` object instead,
i.e. assign
```matlab
student_string = "C.F. Gauss"
```
so `whos student_string` will tell us instead
```
Name                  Size            Bytes  Class     Attributes

student_string       1x1               156  string              
```
Summing up:
- An *array of `char`* is a sequence of characters, just as a numeric vector
is a sequence of numbers. Its typical use is to store short pieces of text as
character vectors,
- A `string` object, that is, an *array* of` string` is a container for parts
of text. *Arrays of Strings* provide a variety of functions for working with
text as data.

## Some functions you should remember

MATLAB contains a large number of already implemented mathematical functions,
some of them, the most frequently used ones, are listed in {numref}`tabfunzionidibase`

```{list-table} alcune funzioni di base.
:header-rows: 1
:name: tabfunzionidibase

* - Function
  - MATLAB
  - Function
  - MATLAB
* - Cosine
  - `cos`
  - Square root
  - `sqrt`
* - Sine
  - `sin`
  - Exponential
  - `exp`
* - Tangent
  - `tan`
  - Logarithm (base 10)
  - `log10`
* - Cotangent

  - Logarithm (natural)
  - `log`

  - `acos`
  - Round to the nearest integer
  - `round`

  - `atan`
  - Round up to the integer $\leq$
  - `floor`
* - Arc tangent
  - `acot`
  - Round up to the integer $\geq$
  - `ceil`
```
:::{danger}
The trigonometric functions thus expressed take the inputs in radians, that is,
the inverse functions return the angle in radians. Versions that use degrees
are invoked with the suffix `d`, e.g.,` cosd`, `acosd`.
:::

If you encounter a function you don't know how to use, you can query the
MATLAB help from the **command window** with, for example,
```matlab
help cosd
```
which will print essential information
```
cosd   Cosine of argument in degrees.
   cosd(X) is the cosine of the elements of X, expressed in degrees.
   For odd integers n, cosd(n*90) is exactly zero, whereas cos(n*pi/2)
   reflects the accuracy of the floating point value for pi.

   Class support for input X:
      float: double, single

   See also acosd, cos.

   Documentation for cosd
   Other functions named cosd
```
so you can then access the complete information using the link
*Documentation for ...*.

A final couple of extremely useful functions are the
- `clear` functions which clear the **workspace** of all variables, i.e.` clear variablename1 variablename2`
which only clears the variables `variablename1` and` variablename2`,
- ` clc` which clears the content printed in the **command window**.

## Script creation

All (or almost) the commands seen so far are actually **scripts** or **functions**
pre-built and made available in the general environment. MATLAB allows the user
to build his own scripts and functions for solving specific problems.

A **script file** is simply a *collection* of MATLAB executable commands and,
in some more refined cases, interfaces to external software produced in C or
Fortran.

To create a new script just *click* on the **New script** icon,
{numref}`newscript`, which will open a new *editor* window where you can
write your own program.

```{figure} ./images/newscript.png
:name: newscript

Create a new script.
```

As we said, a script is nothing more than a sequence of commands to be inserted
in the editor window. In order to *execute* the script it must be saved in the
**Current Folder**.

:::{warning}
The naming conventions for scripts are the same as for variable names
({ref} `sec-variables`), in particular it is extremely important to avoid using
predefined MATLAB function names.
:::

You can **run** the script
1. Click on the **Run** button ![Run](/images/mrun.png)
2. Enter the name with which the script was saved in the **command window**
(without the `.m` extension).

:::{admonition} Esempio
Let's turn our code for calculating the surface area of a sphere into a script.
That is, we write in the editor:
   ```matlab
   radius = 5;
   surface_area = 4 * pi * radius ^ 2;
   disp ("The Surface Area of the Sphere is:"); disp (surface_area);
   ```
We save the file as `spherearea.m` and run it once with the **Run** button and
once by writing `spherearea` in the **Command Window**.
:::

**To summarize** Script files are extremely useful when you intend to run
sequences of many MATLAB commands. For example, let's imagine a sequence of
calculations divided into $n$ commands, after having entered them all in the
*prompt* we realize that the value assigned to a variable in the first command
is wrong, or we want to change it. Working only in the **command window** we
should fix the error in the first command, then rerun the other $n-1$ commands.

If we had produced a script instead, we could simply correct the first command
and rerun the entire sequence by pressing a single key or typing a single
command: the name of the script.

## Creating Functions

A function (also called, depending on the programming language, routine,
  subroutine, procedure, method), is a particular syntactic construct that
  groups within a single program, a sequence of instructions in a single block.
  Its purpose is to carry out an operation, action, or processing in such a way
  that, starting from certain *inputs*, it returns certain *outputs*.

In MATLAB a function named `myfunction` is declared as` function [y1, ..., yN] = myfunction (x1, ..., xM) ` which accepts as *input* `x1, ..., xM` and returns as * output * `y1, ..., yN`.
This declaration **must** be the first executable statement of the file that
contains the function. Valid function names begin with an alphabetic character
and can contain letters, numbers, or *underscores*.

You can save a function in
- a function file that contains only function definitions. The file name *must*
exactly match the name of the first function in the file;
- a script that contains commands and function definitions. In this case the
functions *must* be contained at the end of the file and the *script* cannot
have the same name as any of the functions contained within it.

Files can include multiple local or nested functions. In order to
produce human readable code, it is recommended to always use the `end`
keyword to indicate the end of any function within a file.

In particular, the `end` keyword is required whenever:
- any function in a file contains a nested function,
- the function is a *local* function within a file that contains only functions
and, in turn, each local function uses the keyword `end`,
- the function is a *local* function inside a *script*.

To interrupt the execution of a function before reaching the final `end`, you can
use the` return` keyword which, as the name suggests, returns control to the script
that invoked the function. A direct call to the script or function that contains
`return` does not invoke any source program and instead returns control to the
command prompt.

:::{admonition} Example
We transform our code for calculating the surface area of a sphere into a function.
That is, we write in the editor:
`` matlab
function [surface_area] = areasphere(radius)
%% AREASPHERE Function that calculates the surface area of a sphere of radius r
surface_area = 4 * pi * radius ^ 2;
end
``
We save the file as `areasfera.m` and we can execute the function directly
in the **command window** such as
1. `area_surface = areasphere (radius)`,
2. `area_surface = areasphere (radius);`,
3. `areasphere (radius)`.
Note the differences.
:::

## Arrays and Matrices

We have been discussing the use of scalar variables so far, however in MATLAB,
data is naturally represented as **matrices**, **arrays** and, more generally,
**tensors**. You can apply all linear algebra operations to arrays, plus you can
create common grids, combine existing arrays, manipulate the shape and content
of an array, and use different indexing modes to access their elements.

In fact, we have already surreptitiously worked with arrays, since in MATLAB
even scalar variables are nothing more than one-dimensional arrays, in mathematical
notation an $a \in \mathbb{R}$ is always a $a \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times 1}$.
In fact, if we write in the **command window**:
```matlab
a = 100;
whos a
```
the system will give us back
```
Name      Size            Bytes  Class     Attributes

a         1x1                 8  double   
```
Now let's imagine that we have a specific set of data, which we want to arrange
in a matrix. We can do this using the semantics of square brackets `[]`.

A single line of data contains spaces or commas `,` between elements and uses
a semicolon `;` to separate rows.

For example, if we want to create a single row of three numeric elements
```matlab
v = [ 1 2 3]
```
or
```matlab
v = [ 1, 2, 3]
```
The resulting matrix size is 1 by 3, as it has one row and three columns.
A matrix of this form is called a **row vector** and if we call the `isrow (v)`
function we get the answer
```
ans =

  logical

   1
```
Similarly, we can construct a **column vector** as
```matlab
w = [ 1; 2; 3]
```
so we have that `iscolumn(w)` will return us instead
```
ans =

  logical

   1
```
More generally, we can construct an array of $ 4 \times 4 $ elements like
```matlab
A = [ 1 2 3 4; 5 6 7 8; 9 10 11 12; 13 14 15 16]
```
or as
```matlab
A = [ 1, 2, 3, 4; 5, 6, 7, 8; 9, 10, 11, 12; 13, 14, 15, 16]
```
or
```matlab
A = [ 1, 2, 3, 4
      5, 6, 7, 8
      9, 10, 11, 12
      13, 14, 15, 16]
```
In all cases we will see ourselves returned
```matlab
A =

     1     2     3     4
     5     6     7     8
     9    10    11    12
    13    14    15    16
```
We can investigate the dimensions of an array using the `size (A)` function,
which in the previous case will return us
```
ans =

     4     4
```
### Default constructors

Constructing arrays simply by inserting values into them sequentially or
explicitly is clearly cumbersome (and very boring). For this purpose MATLAB has
the constructors listed in {numref}`costruttoriarray`.

```{list-table} Constructors for arrays and matrices.
:header-rows: 1
:name: costruttoriarray

* - Function
  - Result
* - `zeros`
  - **Create an array of all zeros**
    To build the matrix $0 = (O)_{i,j}$ $i,j=1,\ldots,n$ we write
    ```matlab
    O = zeros(n,m);
    ```
* - `ones`
  - **Create an array of all ones**
    To build the matrix $1 = (E)_{i,j}$ $i,j=1,\ldots,n$ we write
    ```matlab
    E = ones(n,m);
    ```
* - `rand`
  - **Create an array of evenly distributed random numbers** in $[0,1]$.
    ```matlab
    R = rand(n,m);
    ```
    We can generate evenly distributed numbers in the range $ [a, b] $ as
    ```matlab
    R = a + (b-a).*rand(n,m);
    ```
* - `eye`
  - **Identity matrix** builds the identity matrix $(I)_{i,i} = 1$, $i=1,\ldots,n$
  and $0$ otherwise `I = eye(n)`.
* - `diag`
  - Creates a **diagonal matrix** or extracts the diagonal elements of a given matrix. If `v` is a vector of length $n$, then `diag(v)` is a matrix whose leading diagonal is given by the elements of` v`. If `A` is a matrix then`diag(v)` is a vector containing the elements of the leading diagonal of $A$.
```

Other functions of the same type are `true`,` false`, `blkdiag` and theirs
operation can be explored using the `help` function.

The second set of functions extremely useful for building matrices is the one
that deals with managing concatenations. These can be obtained either by using
the notation with square brackets `[]`, for example,
```matlab
A = rand(5,5);
B = rand(5,10);
C = [A,B];
```
builds from matrices $ A \in \ mathbb {R}^ {5 \times 5} $,
$ B \in \mathbb{R}^{5 \times 10} $, the matrix $ C \in \mathbb{R} ^ {5 \times 15}$
obtained by placing next to each other all the columns of $ A $ followed by those of $ B $.
Similarly, vertical concatenation can be achieved as
```matlab
A = rand(8,8);
B = rand(12,8);
C = [A;B];
```
which will generate the $ C \in \mathbb{R}^{20,8}$ matrix obtained by stacking all
lines of $ A $ followed by lines of $ B $.

:::{danger}
The concatenation operations must be done between matrices of compatible size,
there can be no "leftovers" between the dimensions in question. To try to get
an error, execute:
```matlab
A = rand(5,5);
B = rand(5,10);
C = [A;B];
```
which will return
```
Error using vertcat
Dimensions of arrays being concatenated are not consistent.
```
:::
Instead of the notation with square brackets it is possible to make use of the
functions `horzcat` and` vertcat` which correspond, respectively, to the
concatenations of the form `[,]` and `[;]`.

If we want to build instead a diagonal block matrix starting from the diagonal
blocks we can use the `blkdiag` function whose` help` gives us exactly
```
blkdiag  Block diagonal concatenation of matrix input arguments.

                                   |A 0 .. 0|
   Y = blkdiag(A,B,...)  produces  |0 B .. 0|
                                   |0 0 ..  |

   Class support for inputs:
      float: double, single
      integer: uint8, int8, uint16, int16, uint32, int32, uint64, int64
      char, logical
```

### Slicing: access elements

The most common way to access a particular element of an array or matrix is to
explicitly specify the indices of the elements.
For **example**, to access a single element of an array, specify the row number
followed by the column number of the element:
```matlab
A = [ 1 2 3 4
      17 8 2 1];
A(2,1)
```
which will print in the **command window** `17`, i.e. the element in row 2 and
column 1 position of `A` ($ a_{2,1} $).

We can also refer to multiple elements at a time by specifying their indices
in a vector. For **example**, we access the first and fourth elements of the
second line of the previous `A` by doing
```matlab
A(2,[1,4])
```
which will return
```
ans =

    17     1
```
To access elements in a range of rows or columns, you can use the colon operator
`:`. For example, we can access the elements from the first to the fifth row and
from the second to the sixth column of a $ A $ matrix as
```matlab
A = rand(10,10);
A(1:5,2:6)
```
If you want to scroll to the end of a dimension, you can replace the value on
the right in the `:` with the keyword `end`, for example:
```matlab
A(1:5,2:end)
```
Instead, using `:` without start/end values extracts all entries of the relative
dimension, for example, 5 column, `A(:, 5)`, or 4th to 7th columns, `A(:,4:7)`.

```{note}
In general, indexing can be used to access elements of any array in MATLAB
**regardless** of data type or size.
```
The last way to *slice* a vector we want to talk about is by using
**logical vectors**. Using the `true` and` false` logical flags is especially
effective when working with conditional statements.
For **example**, suppose we want to know if the elements of one $A$ array are
greater than the corresponding elements of another  $B$ array. The comparison
operator applied to the two arrays returns a logical array whose elements are
1 when an element in $A$ satisfies the comparison with the corresponding
element in $ B $.
```matlab
A = [1 2 6; 4 3 6];
B = [0 3 7; 3 7 5];
ind = A>B
A(ind)
B(ind)
```
gives us back
```
ind =

  2×3 logical array

   1   0   0
   1   0   1


ans =

     1
     4
     6


ans =

     0
     3
     5
```
Comparison operators are not the only ones for which this can be done, MATLAB
itself implements a number of useful functions for this purpose, see
`isnan`,` isfinite`, `isinf`,` ismissing`. It is also possible to combine
several requests together using the **logical operators**, see the section on
{ref}`sec-ifelsestuff` below.

### Operations between arrays and matrices

MATLAB supports all operations that make sense in terms of linear algebra,
therefore matrix-vector products, sums of matrices and vectors, transposition,
conjugation, *etc.*, with the same consistency constraints between the
operators.
Specifically, the product $ A \mathbf{v} $ with $ A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k_1}$
and $\mathbf {v} \in \mathbb{R}^{k_2}$ is possible if and only if $k_1 \equiv k_2$,
let's consider for example
```matlab
A = [1 2 3 4;
     4 3 2 1;
     2 4 3 1;
     3 2 4 1];
v1 = [1,2,3,4];
v2 = [1;2;3;4];
```
and let's try to calculate
- `A*v1` from which we get an error:
```
Error using  *
Incorrect dimensions for matrix multiplication. Check that the number of columns in the first matrix matches the number of rows in the second matrix. To perform elementwise multiplication, use '.*'.
```
  since we are trying to do an operation that does not make sense from the point
  of view of linear algebra.
- `A*v2` instead it is the correct operation and we get
```
ans =

    30
    20
    23
    23
```
- `v1*A` also this operation makes sense from the matrix point of view and in
fact we get
```
ans =

    27    28    32    13
```
- `v2*A` it has the same problem as the first, that is, we again have dimensions
that are not consistent
```
Error using  *
Incorrect dimensions for matrix multiplication. Check that the number of columns in the first matrix matches the number of rows in the second matrix. To perform elementwise multiplication, use '.*'.
```
- `A*v1'` here we introduce the transpose-conjugate operation (which, since we
  are using vectors of real numbers, coincides with the simple transposition
  operation `. ''), which leads us to have the correct dimensions and returns
```
ans =

    30
    20
    23
    23
```
- `A*v2'` transposition in this case makes the dimensions of `v2` incompatible
so we get the same error again
```
Error using  *
Incorrect dimensions for matrix multiplication. Check that the number of columns in the first matrix matches the number of rows in the second matrix. To perform elementwise multiplication, use '.*'.
```

:::{warning}
The error message we encountered tells us that the operation does not make sense
in terms of the usual operations of linear algebra, however it suggests that
what we might have intended to do was an **elementwise** product or "element by
element ". This is done by using the `. *` Operator, that is, with a `.` prefix
in front of the product operator which usually means" execute in an
element-by-element fashion ". Let's try the first wrong operation we proposed:
```matlab
A.*v1
```
that gives us back
```
ans =

     1     4     9    16
     4     6     6     4
     2     8     9     4
     3     4    12     4
```
What operation did we perform? Try also the exponentiation operations
```matlab
A^3
A.^3
v1^3
v1.^3
```
and describe the result.
:::

The last two operations we have left to describe are `+` / `-`. Again we have to
worry about the compatibility of the operations we want to carry out. If we
want to be sure we are doing the sum of arrays and matrices we have in mind
we have to make sure that the dimensions are compatible.

Suppose we have the row and column vectors
```matlab
v = [1 2 3 4]
w = [1
     2
     3
     4]
```
if we want to add or subtract them and obtain a vector row or column, we must
ensure that both have the correct size. That is, we must have, respectively,
```matlab
v + w'
```
or
```matlab
v' + w
```
If we inadvertently add the two vectors as
```matlab
v + w
```
we get instead
```
ans =

     2     3     4     5
     3     4     5     6
     4     5     6     7
     5     6     7     8
```
which is instead a matrix! Not exactly what we expected (can you figure out what
  operation we got?). Equal caution should be exercised in writing addition/subtraction
  operations between matrices and vectors.
   Try running:
  ```
  A = pascal(4);
  v = [1 3 2 4];
  A + v
  A + v'
  A + 0.5
  v + 1
  ```

It is legitimate to wonder at this point why these operations are performed
without returning errors. Even if from the point of view of pure linear algebra
these operations are not immediately sensible, from the implementation point of
view they allow to simplify (and speed up) a certain number of operations that
would otherwise require several lines of code (whose optimization for
performance does not is taken for granted) to be implemented.

## Selection and Conditional Structures

```{list-table} Conditional Structures.
:header-rows: 1
:name: tabcondizionali

* - MATLAB Function
  - Description
* - `if, elseif, else`
  - Execute command if the `if` condition is true
* - `switch, case, otherwise`
  - Executes one or more groups of commands depending on whether the `switch`
  variable has the value indicated in the` case`, otherwise it executes the
  command or group of commands identified by `otherwise`
* - `try, catch`
  - Executes the commands in the `try` group, if they return an error it does
  not block the execution and passes to the commands collected in the` catch`
```

Let's consider the following example that simulates the flip of a coin.
```matlab
a = rand();
if a < 0.5
  disp('Head!')
else
  disp('Tail')
end
```
With each new execution, `rand ()` generates a random number in $ [0,1] $ with
uniform probability. The `if` command checks if the random number generated is
$ <0.5 $ and in this case enters the first code group. Otherwise, we have got a
number $> 0.5 $ and we fall into the second group of code. We can also decide
to simulate a three-sided die in the following way
```matlab
a = rand();
if a < 1/3
  disp('1')
elseif a >= 1/3 & a < 2/3
  disp('2')
else
  disp('3')
end
```
where we used the `elseif` command to have an additional branch.

```{note}
Within our `if` checks (and more generally) we can combine the result of several
logical operations together. These are collected in Table {numref}`logicalops`.
Other functions that operate on logical vectors and which you can explore by
calling the `help` function are `any` and `all`.

```{list-table} Logical operations
:header-rows: 1
:name: logicalops

* - MATLAB Function
  - Description
* - `&`
  - Logical AND
* - `~`
  - Logical NOT
* - `|`
  - Logical OR
* - `xor`	 
  - Logical exclusive OR
```

We also see an example of the `switch` type statement.
```matlab
control = input("Insert an integer between 0 and 3:");
switch control
case 0
 A = pascal(4,4);
 disp(A);
case 1
 A = ones(4,4);
 disp(A);
case 2
 A = eye(4,4);
 disp(A);
case 3
 A = rand(4,4);
 disp(A);
otherwise
 disp ("I don't know what to do with this input!")
end
```
The same code could have been implemented with a series of `if` and` elseif`
and an `else`, but this approach is quicker if there is no need to enforce many
logical checks.

The last control we want to test is `try`. So you can try the following code.
```matlab
try
 A = rand(5,5);
 b = ones(1,5);
 A*b
catch
 disp ("There is some problem with the size!");
end
```
Since the algebraic operation we requested is not well posed (try to execute it
  outside the `try` operation) the` try` catches the error and instead of
  stopping the execution it executes the code in the `catch` clause . You can
  correct the code in the first block and verify that you will not enter the
  `catch` in that case.

## Cycles and Nested Cycles

Within any program, you can define sections of code that repeat in a loop.

```{list-table} Strutture Condizionali.
:header-rows: 1
:name: tabcicli
* - Funzione di MATLAB
  - Descrizione
* - `for`
  - `for` loop to repeat statements a fixed number of times
* - `while`
  - The `while` loop repeats its code as long as the condition is` true`
* - `break`
  - Forcibly terminates the execution of a `for` or` while` loop
* - `continue`
  - Pass control to the next iteration of a `for` or` while` loop
* - `pause`
  - Temporarily pause MATLAB execution.
```

We use a `for` loop to calculate the sum of the first` n` integers.
```matlab
n = input ("Insert an integer n:");
summation = 0;
for i=1:n
  summation = summation + i;
end
fprintf ("The sum of the integers 1 to% d is% d. \ n", n, summation);
```
This is obviously not the best way to do this, for example we could have
calculated the same quantity as `sum (1:10)`. Or, use some mathematical ideas
to remind us that $ \displaystyle S_n = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} i = \frac{n (n + 1)}{2}.$
But it helped our demonstration purpose.

Let's now look at an example of a `while` loop.
```matlab
summation = 0;
while summation < 10
  summation = summation + rand();
end
fprintf ("The final value of the sum is:% f \ n", summation);
```
Since we initialized the `summation` variable to 0, the trigger condition of the
`while` loop is `true` and so we start iterating. With each new instance of the
loop a new random number is generated and added to the `summation` variable.
As soon as the `summation` value exceeds 10, the cycle is interrupted and the
message is printed on the screen.

## Some exercises

The exercises collected here are mostly intended to verify that you have
absorbed this general information about the MATLAB language, so that we can
concentrate on implementing algorithms for the solution of some modeling problem.

::::{exercise}
The golden constant $\varphi$ can be expressed in compact form as
```{math}
\varphi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}.
```
Let's assume we don't have an algorithm for extracting square roots, then we
can try to approximate the value of $\phi$ using its continued fraction expansion:
```{math}
\varphi = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \vdots } } } } } }
```
Write a function with the following prototype:
```matlab
function phi = fractionphi(n)
%% FRACTIONPHI takes as input the number of terms to use
% in the continuous fraction approximation of the golden section e
% returns the approximation.
end
```
* To build the function implementation, use a `for` loop.
   **Hint** organize the calculation starting from the "lowest level" to the
   highest one.
* Suppose we know that an exact value of $\varphi $ with 16 significant digits
  is `1.6180339887498949`. Change the previous function to a new function with
  the following prototype
  ```matlab
  function [n,phi] = howmanytermsphi(tol)
  %%HOWMANYTERMSPHI given in input a tolerance tol on the distance between
   % the approximation of the constant phi and the real value of this function
   % gives us the number of terms needed and the approximation value

  phitrue = 1.6180339887498949;

  end
  ```
  To do this we use a `while` loop and the` abs` function (which implements
    the absolute value) to measure the **absolute error** between our
    approximation and the true value.
::::

::::{exercise}
Let's practice building a *recursive function* now. A sequence linked to the
golden constant $\varphi$ is the Fibonacci sequence, i.e. the sequence of
integers $ \{F_n \}_n = \{1,1,2,3,5, \ldots \} $ given by
```{math}
F_{n+1} = F_{n} + F_{n-1}, \text{ se } n \geq 1, \; F_{1} = 1,\;F_{0} = 1.
```
* Implement a *recursive function* that computes the $ n $th Fibonacci number
$n$ using only the `switch` conditional structure, by using the following
prototype
```matlab
function f = fibonacci(n)
%FIBONACCI Recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. Takes
% in input the number n and returns the nth Fibonacci number Fn.
end
```
* The function thus constructed has an unfortunate flaw, if we feed it  $n$ it
gives us the $ n $th number, however if we subsequently ask for the $ n + 1 $th
the calculation to obtain it has no memory of what we have done and recalculates
all the previous ones anyway. Now let's build a **non-recursive version** of
the `fibonacci` function. We can achieve it in several ways, but almost certainly
we will need a `for` loop.
```matlab
function f = fibonaccinonrecursive(n)
%FIBONACCINONRECURSIVE Non-recursive implementation of the sequence
% Fibonacci. It takes the number n as input and returns a vector
% which contains all the Fibonacci numbers from F0 to Fn.
end
```
* Let's now take advantage of the second implementation we made of the Fibonacci
function to build a different sequence. Let us consider the Viswanath sequence
{cite}`Viswanath` thus defined
```{math}
v_{n+1} = v_{n} \pm v_{n-1}, \; n \geq 1,
```
where  $v_{0}$ and $V_{1}$ are assigned at will and the $\pm$ has the following
interpretation: with probability $ 1/2 $ we add, with probability $ 1/2 $ we
subtract. One idea to implement this function is to use the `sign` function
(see what it is for by doing` help sign`). A prototype for this function is
for example
```matlab
function v = viswanath(n,v0,v1)
%VISWANATH Non-recursive implementation of the sequence
% of Viswanath. It takes as input the number n, the values of v0 and v1 and
% returns a vector that contains all Viswanath numbers v0 through vn.
end
```
* Once our function is built, we can visualize what we get with it (and compare
  it with the Fibonacci sequence) via the script:
```matlab
%% Viswanath sequence test

n = 1000; % Number of terms

% Let's calculate the Fibonacci sequence
f = fibonaccinonrecursive(n);

% We compute the Viswanath sequence
v0 = 1;
v1 = 1;
v = viswanath(n,v0,v1);

% Asymptotic value
c = 1.13198824;
phi = (1+sqrt(5))/2;
figure(1)
semilogy(0:n,abs(v),'o',0:n,c.^(1:n+1),'-',0:n,f,'x',0:n,phi.^(1:n+1),'-');
legend({'Viswanath','Asymptotic estimation','Fibonacci','Asymptotic estimation'},...
    'Location','northwest')
```
In the terminal part of the script `% Asymptotic value` we are going to compare
in semi-logarithmic scale on the $ y $ axis the absolute values of the numbers
$ \{v_n\}_n $ and the $\{F_n \}_n$. In particular we can observe that for both
sequences we find a number $ k $ for which they grow as $ k^{n + 1}$.
In particular, for the Fibonacci sequence this $ k $ is the golden constant
$\varphi$ of the previous exercise, while for the Viswanath sequence it is
the value $ c = 1.13198824 \ldots $ (for a proof see {cite}`Viswanath`).

**Let's take advantage** of this also to see how you can get function graphs
on MATLAB, to decode the commands in this section use `help`. An example of the
graph obtained with the previous script is the following:

## Writing data to screen and to file

MATLAB provides a fairly transparent porting of C's screen printing functions
(on data streams). That is, the fprintf function. For screen printing the
prototype of this function is
```
fprintf(FORMAT, A, ...)
```
where FORMAT is a string that contains information about the format to be
printed and `A` is an array that contains the data to be printed according to
the FORMAT format. In general this is a string that can contain text accompanied
by *escape* characters that tell you how to format the data contained in the
`A` variable.
![Caratteri di *escape* per il formato](./images/format.png)

As described in the image, the *escape* for a formatting operator begins with
the percent sign, `%`, and ends with a conversion character ({numref}`conversioncharacter`).
The conversion character is required. Optionally, you can specify an identifier,
flags, field width, *precision*, and a *subtype* operator between the `%` and the
conversion.

```{list-table} Conversion characters
:header-rows: 1
:name: conversioncharacter
* - Carattere
  - Conversione
* - `%d` o `%i`
  - Intero base 10
* - `%f`
  - Floating point fixed precision
* - `%e`
  - Floating point scientific notation
* - `%c`
  - Single character
* - `%s`
  - String
```
An example:
```{code-block} matlab
fprintf("%f \n",pi);
fprintf("%e \n",5*10^20);
fprintf("%1.2f \n",pi);
fprintf("%1.2e \n",5*10^20);
fprintf("%c \n",'a')
fprintf("%s \n",'Ciao, mondo!')
```
In the example we have repeatedly used the `\n` characters which symbolize a
newline character. Other useful characters of this type are in
{numref}`carformattazione`.
```{list-table} Formatting characters
:header-rows: 1
:name: carformattazione
* - Result
  - String
* - Single quotation mark
  - `''`
* - Percent symbol
  - `%%`
* - Backslash
  - `\\`
* - Backspace
  - `\b`
* - Tab horizontal
  - `\t`
* - Tab vertical
  - `\v`
```
More information can be obtained by writing `help fprintf` in the
*command line*.
